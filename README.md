## Project no. 3 â€“ Labyrinth solver

Create a python project that is able to design a 2D labyrinth and find the exit from any starting point. The program has to accept the following parameters as input:


- the size of the labyrinth in both directions
- the starting point for the exit finding

The program should provide the following features:


- Create a random arbitrary size labyrinth
- Find the way out using brute-force (trying all combinations) and/or using Q learning.

For the labyrinth generation, you can use e.g. the following algorithm:

1. Set the size of the labyrinth and choose a random exit point.

2. Split the labyrinth with a horizontal line in a random place with a hole (size=1 unit) in a random place.

3. Split the labyrinth vertically in random places with holes.

4. Recursively repeat the process for the new rectangles. If one size of the rectangle is 1 unit then stop the recursive action for that specific rectangle. Repeat the process until all rectangles have a one unit size.
